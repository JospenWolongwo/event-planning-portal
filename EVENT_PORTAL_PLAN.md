## Code Organization

### Services Structure
We've centralized database operations into service modules:
- `/lib/services/event-service.ts` - Event CRUD operations
- `/lib/services/registration-service.ts` - Registration management
- `/lib/services/user-service.ts` - User and auth operations
- `/lib/services/payment-service.ts` - Payment processing

### Type Definitions
All types are centralized in:
- `/lib/types/index.ts`
