# PikDrive Deployment Guide

## Recommended Hosting Platform

For a Next.js application with Supabase backend, we recommend using **Vercel** over Hostinger for the following reasons:

1. **Next.js Optimization**
   - Built by the same team as Next.js
   - Zero-config deployment
   - Automatic performance optimization
   - Built-in Edge Functions support

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Native integration with Supabase
   - Automatic environment variable handling
   - Edge function compatibility
   - Real-time database connections optimization

3. **PWA Support**
   - Automatic service worker handling
   - Built-in HTTPS
   - Automatic SSL certificate management
   - Edge caching for better PWA performance

## Alternative Hosting Options

While we recommend Vercel, here are other viable options:

1. **Railway**
   - Good Supabase integration
   - Simple deployment process
   - Reasonable pricing

2. **Netlify**
   - Excellent CI/CD
   - Good serverless support
   - Strong community

3. **Hostinger (Your Current Provider)**
   - Can work but requires more setup
   - Manual configuration needed
   - Less optimized for Next.js

### Using Hostinger with Your Current Plan

If you decide to use Hostinger:

1. Additional Setup Required:
   - Manual Node.js configuration
   - Custom server setup
   - PM2 process manager
   - Nginx reverse proxy

2. Performance Considerations:
   - Set up proper caching
   - Configure CDN
   - Optimize server settings

3. Required Commands:
   ```bash
   # Build the application
   npm run build

   # Install PM2
   npm install -g pm2

   # Start the application
   pm2 start npm --name "pikdrive" -- start
   ```

## Recommendation

We strongly recommend using Vercel for the following reasons:
1. Seamless Next.js deployment
2. Better performance out of the box
3. Easier maintenance and updates
4. Native Supabase integration
5. Automatic HTTPS and SSL
6. Better PWA support
7. Simplified deployment process

You can still keep your domain with Hostinger and just point it to Vercel's servers. This gives you the best of both worlds - professional Next.js hosting while maintaining your existing domain management.
